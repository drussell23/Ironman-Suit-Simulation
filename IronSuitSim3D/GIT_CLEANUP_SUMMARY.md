# Git Cleanup Summary for IronSuitSim3D

## Problem
You had 10,000+ files showing as changes in Git because Unity generates many temporary files.

## Solution Applied

1. **Created `.gitignore`** in the IronSuitSim3D folder to exclude:
   - `/Library/` - Unity's cache (thousands of files)
   - `/Temp/` - Temporary build files
   - `/Logs/` - Log files
   - `/UserSettings/` - User-specific settings
   - `*.csproj`, `*.sln` - Auto-generated project files
   - Other build artifacts

2. **Added only essential files to Git:**
   - `/Assets/` - Your game assets and scripts
   - `/ProjectSettings/` - Unity project configuration
   - `/Packages/` - Package dependencies
   - `.gitignore` - The ignore rules

## Result
- Reduced from 10,000+ files to ~61 tracked files
- Only important project files are now tracked
- Temporary/cache files are ignored

## Going Forward

### What SHOULD be in Git:
- Assets/ (scripts, models, textures, etc.)
- ProjectSettings/ (project configuration)
- Packages/manifest.json (package list)

### What should NOT be in Git:
- Library/ (can be regenerated)
- Temp/ (temporary files)
- Logs/ (log files)
- obj/ (build intermediates)
- *.csproj, *.sln (auto-generated)

## Commands to Remember

```bash
# If you accidentally track Library files again:
git rm -r --cached IronSuitSim3D/Library/
git rm -r --cached IronSuitSim3D/Temp/
git rm -r --cached IronSuitSim3D/Logs/

# To see what's being tracked:
git ls-files | grep IronSuitSim3D/ | grep -E "(Library|Temp|Logs)/"

# To clean untracked files (BE CAREFUL):
git clean -n  # Dry run first
git clean -f  # Actually clean
```

Your Unity project is now properly configured for Git!
